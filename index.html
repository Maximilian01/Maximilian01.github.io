            <h2>About</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Maximilian grew up on a small island in northern Ohio called Middle Bass. The island is
                relatively small; it has a year-round population of less than fifty people and an area
                of roughly 800 acres.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maximilian attended Put-in-Bay School on South Bass. While Middle Bass has a school district, it
                has no operational school facility. Thus, Maximilian and the other Middle Bass children were
                transported by the Middle Bass School District to Put-in-Bay School. The transportation methods
                used throughout the years have varied significantly. When Maximilian was a child, he and his
                classmates were transported by boat during the fall and spring. When Lake Erie would freeze
                during the winter, Maximilian and his classmates were transported by airplane. Later, Maximilian
                and his classmates would be transported solely by airplane. If the planes could not fly and Lake
                Erie was frozen, Maximilian would go to school by traveling across the ice. Maximilian participated
                in a number of clubs while at Put-in-Bay School. He was a member of student council, the computer
                club, the quiz bowl team, the mens' Basketball team, and the robotics club. Maximilian graduated
                from Put-in-Bay School in 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the fall of 2019, Maximilian joined Miami University's class of 2023 as a computer science
                major. He lived in Peabody Hall during his freshman year. During the same year, Maximilian 
                and his friend David would start the student organization Green Gamers. Green Gamers is an
                organization which aims to promote sustainable practices through education and video games.
                Maximilian would serve as the treasurer of Green Gamers until the fall of 2022.

                Maximilian's sophomore year was spent on an empty campus. COVID-19 was in full swing during 
                his sophomore year. Thus, all classes and activities were online. Despite this, Maximilian
                was living on campus in the basement of Morris Hall; he was employed as a Resident Assistant,
                and therefore had to live in the dorms. Maximilian picked up an electrical engineering minor
                during this year.
            </p>
            <p>
                During Maximilian's junior year, classes returned to in-person delivery. He was still serving
                as a Resident Assistant in Morris Hall; however, he moved from the basement to the third floor.
                During the spring semester, Maximilian joined Dr. Mark Scott's research team as an undergraduate 
                researcher in the Power Electronics Laboratory. 
            </p>
            <p>
                During the summer of 2022, Maximilian spent five weeks studying abroad at the University of
                Calabria in Italy. He was joined by twenty-three other Miami University students and two Miami
                University faculty. Later that summer, Maximilian was admitted to Miami University's Computer
                Science graduate program as a combined bachelor's/master's student.
            </p>
            <p>
                During Maximilian's senior year, he joined Dr. Mark Scott's Power Electronics Laboratory as
                a graduate research assistant. He would also join Dr. Mark Scott's and Dr. Miao Wang's senior
                capstone team; their goal was to produce Bluetooth-enabled intelligent solar cells. Maximilian
                was the only software developer on the team. In the end, he produced a SCADA system which could
                collecte data from solar cells using Bluetooth Low Energy and display it on a website. At the
                same time, Maximilian became an advisee of Dr. Eric Rapos; Maximilian's thesis would involve
                applying Model-Driven Software Engineering practices to embedded Bluetooth Low Energy applications.
                Maximilian served as the College of Engineering's student speaker for the 2023 spring
                graduation ceremony.
